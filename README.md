Utility for Old School Runescape for calculating profit margins for certain item production actions.

Old School Runescape has a massive player-ran stock market of sorts called the "Grand Exchange". You can buy and sell your items by setting buy and sell prices.
There are various armor sets which you can buy the legs, top, bottom and weapon individually, or as a bundle. This tool will calculate any profits you can potentially make by calculating the margins between the sum of the prices for individual armor pieces and the actual bundled item.

This was commissioned by a user of GE-tracker.com who wishes to remain anonymous.
